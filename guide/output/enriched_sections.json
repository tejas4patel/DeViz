      "original_text": "Federally qualified health centers and look-alikes are outpatient care settings that provide primary care and other health services in health professional shortage areas and to their populations. Compiling and disseminating data from these centers that is accessible for patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) is critical to understanding healthcare provided at these settings. The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey Health Center (NAMCS HC) Component is a redesigned survey that can be utilized to understand healthcare provided at health centers, improve data capacity, and facilitate PCOR. Beginning in 2021, the NAMCS HC Component began collecting visit data through electronic health record (EHR) submission from a nationally representative sample of FQHCs and FQHC look-alikes. EHR data collected from FQHCs and look-alikes through the redesigned NAMCS HC Component fills a gap to improve PCOR capacity at these unique settings.",

FQHCs and look-alikes are important sources of healthcare in HPSAs, serve to mitigate differences in health outcomes, and allow access to quality healthcare which contributes to reduction in health differences. In 2023, FQHCs served 31.3 million patients in the United States. Patients who use FQHCs may differ from the U.S. population; for example, in 2023 67.3% of FQHC patients were in poverty compared to 11.1% of the U.S population. HRSA oversees and monitors the Health Center Program and currently has a reporting system called the Uniform Data System (UDS) that requires FQHCs and look-alikes to report on selected patient characteristics, services provided, health outcomes, and center staffing.",

      "original_text": "The NAMCS HC Component is a nationally representative establishment survey that collects data on ambulatory medical care visits to FQHCs and FQHC look-alikes throughout the 50 U.S. states and District of Columbia. The NAMCS HC Component collects EHR visit data on patient characteristics, medical diagnoses and procedures, lab tests and results, and medications. Patient personally identifiable information (PII) is also collected, which allows for linkage to external datasets. Its 2021 sampling frame was approximately 1,400 health centers, where a primary sample of 50 health centers was drawn, along with a reserve sample of 100 centers. This yielded 29 health centers participating in the 2021 NAMCS HC Component. Data collection occurs in four steps: (1) sampled health centers are contacted by NCHS to gain agreement to participate, (2) the participating center answers a questionnaire for survey weight calculation, (3) NCHS works with the health center to install the HL7 CDA R2 Implementation Guide, (4) a testing and validation file is submitted, and finally EHR datafiles are submitted to NCHS.",

      "original_text": "Data from the NAMCS HC Component are made publicly available to researchers. The survey does not focus on surveillance of visits for a specific medical condition or type of care, thus its nationally representative data can be used by researchers to explore any healthcare research topic from chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes, to mental health, substance use, and more. NAMCS HC Component data are released annually in two versions: (1) a restricted use datafile containing millions of records from all participating health centers with a full set of data elements, accessible through the NCHS Research Data Center, and (2) a public use version containing 5% of total records collected with weights for nationally representative estimates. The 2023 data showed significantly higher maternal health visit rates among women 20-29 (134.6 per 1,000) and 30-39 (101.0) years compared to women 12-19 (29.7) and 40-55 (20.3) years.",

Users can navigate interactive drop-down menus to examine diagnoses/conditions and health outcome differences across patient characteristics. An empirical example examining lung/breathing-related disease visits by race/ethnicity from January 2022-June 2024 showed that non-Hispanic White people had significantly lower visit rates (10.3-14.3 per 1,000) compared to Hispanic (25.6-31.9) and Non-Hispanic Black (24.1-36.8) populations.",

This linkage focuses on HUD's three largest housing assistance programs: Housing Choice Vouchers (HCV), Public Housing (PH), and assisted Multifamily (MF) programs. Nearly all patients in the 2021 NAMCS HC Component (726,384, or 99.9%) were eligible for linkage with HUD data using deterministic and probabilistic approaches with Fellegi-Sunter methodology. A total of 3.6% of linkage-eligible patients linked to HUD data, with variations by age (0-17: 4.4%, 18-44: 3.0%, 45-64: 3.1%, 65+: 4.7%) and sex (Male: 2.9%, Female: 4.1%).",

However, retention of recruited centers remains high (98.4% in 2023) and new samples each year continue to increase participating centers. Second, not all data elements collected from EHRs are readily-available in public use files. Third, EHR data from some health centers has missingness for certain data elements.
