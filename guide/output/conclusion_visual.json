  "narrative_text": "The NAMCS HC Component has transformed from an ambitious redesign into a proven resource for understanding healthcare at federally qualified health centers. With 95 participating centers, over 9 million annual visits, and a 98.4% retention rate, the foundation is strong. Completed linkages to the National Death Index and HUD housing data, combined with the ongoing Medicaid linkage, create unprecedented opportunities to study how social determinants affect health outcomes for the 31.3 million patients served by health centers. As 2024 datafiles approach release and new dashboard modules expand analytical capabilities, the NAMCS HC Component stands ready to serve researchers, clinicians, patients, and policymakers in their shared mission to improve health outcomes for America's most vulnerable populations."
